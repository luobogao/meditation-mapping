* Data processing flow
1 - Data is loaded from raw file
2 - Every band+channel value is converted from log10 back to absolute value, then averaged over 1,10, and 60 seconds
3 - "Validate" divides every band+channel value by the starting value for a % change, multiplying+rounding by 1000
4 - "Analyze" builds a vector by dividing each band+channel by it's opposite side value (tp10/tp9), then taking the LOG of this percentage to get values in the range of -5 to 5
5 - "RunModel" builds a PCA using these vectors, and also builds a timeseries of cosine/euclidean matches with other waypoints

* State
- "data":
   - "averaged":   rows that have been converted to absolute values and averaged
     ["GammaTP10avg1", "GammaTP10avg10"...]

   - "relative":    values are now a percentage of either the original value or previous values
     ["GammaTP10avg1relative", "GammaTP10avg10relative"...]

   - "projected"
